WEEK 13 Outlook:
Jahmyr Gibbs and the Lions will look to retain their firm first place lead in the NFC North heading into a Week 13 matchup against the fourth place Bears. The Thanksgiving day matchup will be an opportunity for Gibbs - who has scored seven rushing touchdowns in his last six appearances - to thrive on a primetime stage. Gibbs is already up to 10 rushing scores on the year, matching his previous career-high mark from 2023, despite having logged just one TD in the receiving game. He notably outproduced backfield mate David Montgomery during Detroit's 24-6 win over Indianapolis, with a 21-90-2 rushing line while Montgomery went 8-37-1. The final split was heavily influenced by Montgomery exiting in the third quarter with a shoulder injury, but if both backs are available to play Thursday, Gibbs and Montgomery could both thrive against a Chicago defense that ranks 20th against the run but has allowed the third-fewest passing touchdowns to opponents.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Amon-Ra St. Brown will continue to lead Detroit's passing attack as the team prepares for a Thanksgiving day divisional matchup against Chicago in Week 13. The star wideout had his eight-game TD streak broken during the Lions' 24-6 win over Indianapolis, but he remained productive with six catches for 62 yards. St. Brown has now logged six or more targets in four straight games, but keeping up his momentum against the Bears' impressive secondary will be no easy feat. Chicago is fresh off having limited Justin Jefferson to just 27 yards in an overtime loss to the Vikings, and the team could again deploy a defensive scheme that prioritizes removing Jared Goff's No. 1 receiver.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
David Montgomery will work to get healthy and continue operating as the thunder to Jahmyr Gibbs' lightning as the Lions prepare for a Thanksgiving day matchup against the Bears in Week 13. He rushed just eight times for 37 yards during Detroit's 24-6 win over the Colts, with one touchdown. Gibbs, meanwhile, more than doubled up Montgomery with 21 carries for 90 yards and two scores, as a result of Montgomery being forced off the field in the third quarter due to a shoulder injury. He reportedly intends to play through the issue on Thanksgiving day, but if Montgomery is at anything less than 100 percent health, the Lions could reasonably opt to again allot Gibbs a the largest share of backfield work. Still, the Bears are more susceptible against the run (ranking 20th) than the pass (third-fewest passing TDs allowed), so Montgomery could be involved enough to produce even if his overall workload were limited.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Jameson Williams will look to continue demonstrating consistency as the Lions prepare for a Thanksgiving day divisional matchup against the Bears in Week 13. During Detroit's 24-6 win over Indianapolis it was Williams, not Amon-Ra St. Brown, who led the team with 64 receiving yards on five catches. Of course, St. Brown wasn't far behind with six grabs for 62 yards, and neither reached the end zone as Jared Goff was held without a passing touchdown. It's possible the Bears again deploy a defensive gameplan that relies on limiting the opposing No. 1 receiver, while allowing the No. 2 option less attention. In Chicago's most recent loss to the Vikings, in overtime, the Bears allowed just 27 yards to Justin Jefferson while Jordan Addison went off to the tune of a 162-yard receiving line.

In his return from a one-game absence due to a shoulder injury, LaPorta garnered an impressive six targets, the third-most on the team. He translated those into just three grabs for 19 yards, though, just the fourth time this season LaPorta has been held below 30 yards. Now another game removed from the shoulder issue, however, LaPorta could do a better job of producing in primetime versus Chicago.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Tim Patrick will attempt to keep up his momentum on Thanksgiving day as the Lions prepare for a Week 13 divisional matchup against Chicago. The veteran wideout managed to finish third on the team in terms of receiving during Detroit's 24-6 win over the Colts, with four grabs for 55 yards. That total represents Patrick's second-best mark of the season, and his first time over the 50-yard threshold since Week 6. Against a Bears secondary that's allowed the third-fewest passing TDs, it may be difficult for Patrick to continue building momentum, but he's more involved than Kalif Raymond as the No. 3 wideout behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams.

Swift finished with 13 carries for 30 yards and four targets for three catches and 35 yards. While Johnson converted a goal line carry for a touchdwon, Swift saw opportunities in other short yardage situations, which should help improve his touchdown likelihood in future games. In Week 13, the Bears face off against a strong Lions rushing defense. Detroit's defense has allowed 95 rushing yards per game this season, fifth best in the league.

Given Chicago's crowded wide receiver depth chart and the volatile weekly performances of Caleb Williams, Moore could continue to be an inconsistent fantasy option in the near-future. In Week 13, the Bears face off against the Lions. Detroit has allowed 227 passing yards per game this season, eighth most in the league.

While it's a positive sign that Odunze is seeing a lot of opportunities in the offense, his high average depth of target likely plays a role in his mediocre catch rate, making him an inconsistent option for fantasy.

It's unlikely that Kmet will continue to command such a high target share in this offense, and in his four appearances prior to Week 12, he earned just eight total targets. In Week 13, the Bears face off against a Lions defense that has allowed 227 passing yards per game. Detroit has been a very difficult matchup for tight ends this season, and the unit has allowed only 32 yards per game to the position, best in the league.

Johnson finished with two carries for two yards, and he caught his lone target for 10 yards. Even if Johnson continues to be the preferred option in the red zone for the Bears in Week 13 against the Lions, he needs more consistent opportunities to be a reliable fantasy option. Detroit's defense has allowed 95 rushing yards per game this season, fifth best in the league.

Tyrone Tracy gained at least 65 scrimmage yards for the sixth-time in seven contests for the Giants. Tracy rushed for 42 yards and added 28 receiving yards in the 30-7 loss to the Bucs. On the downside, Tracy lost a crucial fumble for the second-straight game, and Devin Singletary also scavenged a one-yard touchdown plunge from the rookie. Given his recent fumbling issues as well as the struggles of the New York offense regardless of who lines up under center, perhaps expectations should be tempered for Tracy in Week 13. However, he will have a juicy matchup versus a Dallas defense that has been dreadful against the run in 2024. Dallas is allowing 150.5 rushing yards per tilt, which is 31st in the NFL. In addition, Dallas has allowed 19 rushing scores, which is dead last in the league.

He still remains the biggest threat in the Raiders' passing game, and he's already only 13 receptions away from breaking Sam LaPorta's NFL record for rookie tight ends. Bowers' momentum could be derailed by uncertainty at quarterback, as Gardner Minshew suffered a season-ending broken collarbone against Denver and will be replaced by either Aidan O'Connell or Desmond Ridder. Regardless of who's under center for Las Vegas in Week 13, they will likely look Bowers' way often against a Kansas City defense that's given up the most receiving yards in the league to TEs.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Jakobi Meyers is coming off his best performance of the season, catching 10 of 15 targets for 121 yards in a Week 12 loss to the Broncos. It's the second time in his last three games he's topped the century mark, but those numbers came with Gardner Minshew under center for the Raiders. With Minshew out for the rest of the year due to a broken collarbone, Meyers will be working with either Aidan O'Connell or Desmond Ridder, potentially affecting his volume and effectiveness. Regardless of who's getting him the ball, Meyers will face a Kansas City secondary in Week 13 that ranks sixth in the league in receiving yards allowed to WRs.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Patrick Mahomes has finally caught fire. The two-time MVP tossed multiple touchdowns in four of Kansas City's last five games, posting a 12:3 TD:INT over that stretch while completing 71.6% of his passes. Mahomes has done it without one dominant target, as Travis Kelce, DeAndre Hopkins, rookie Xavier Worthy and even backup tight end Noah Gray have all taken turns in the spotlight. Mahomes will try to keep rolling in Week 13 against a sagging Raiders defense that has given up 10 TD passes over its last three games.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Travis Kelce has taken a back seat to his understudy over the last two games. While the future Hall of Famer has eight catches for 70 yards on 12 targets during that time, Noah Gray has caught a stunning four TDs. Kelce would need a huge finish to the campaign to reach 1,000 yards for the eighth time in his career, and Patrick Mahomes isn't likely to force the ball to him to try and make it happen. In Week 13, Kansas City does face a Raiders defense that ranks in the bottom eight in the league in catches, receiving yards and touchdowns allowed to TEs.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Isiah Pacheco remains on the cusp of returning from a fractured fibula. The running back has been able to practice for the last two weeks, but with Kareem Hunt adequately handling lead duties in the backfield, Kansas City hasn't been in a hurry to activate Pacheco. Hunt's 3.6 yards per carry over the last six games does suggest that Pacheco will immediately jump back into a significant role as soon as he's deemed ready. If that happens in Week 13, he'll take on a Raiders defense that has been middle of the pack against the run this season and has been more vulnerable through the air of late.

Xavier has yet to catch more than four passes in a contest, and over six games since the Chief's bye he's managed a 16-174-2 line on 33 targets. Coach Andy Reid has publicly committed to getting the speedster more involved, but as yet Worthy hasn't established real chemistry with Patrick Mahomes, limiting his upside. Worthy will try to take a step forward in Week 13 against a Raiders secondary that ranks eighth in the league in receiving yards allowed to WRs, although it has been more vulnerable through the air of late.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Kareem Hunt held onto the top job in the Kansas City backfield for another game in Week 12, gaining 87 scrimmage yards on 19 touches. The veteran RB will soon cede that role to Isiah Pacheco, but as yet the younger back hasn't been cleared to return to the lineup. Hunt's production is purely tied to his workload, as he's managed just 3.6 yards per carry over the last six games but has amassed 510 combined yards and four rushing TDs. If he does retain a significant snap count in Week 13, Hunt will face a Raiders defense that has been middle of the pack against the run and has been more vulnerable through the air of late.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
DeAndre Hopkins found the end zone in Week 12 against the Panthers, his third touchdown in five games since being traded to Kansas City. The veteran wideout has topped six targets only once during that stretch, and while he seems to have earned Patrick Mahomes' trust in the red zone, his 235 receiving yards on 22 catches for his new team is underwhelming. Hopkins also has plenty of competition for those high-value targets, as Travis Kelce, rookie Xavier Worthy and even backup tight end Noah Gray have put together big performances in recent weeks. Hopkins will try to take his turn in Week 13 against a Raiders secondary that got torched by Courtland Sutton in its last game.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Passing game work and a nose for the end zone continue to render Miami's De'Von Achane an every-week RB1. He ran 10 times in Week 12, garnering at least that volume in every healthy game, but he finished with 37 yards or fewer for the second time in three weeks and fifth time overall, but balanced that with two receiving scores and his fifth straight game with at least four receiving targets. Week 13 presents with a Thanksgiving Day matchup outdoors at Green Bay where the ground game could be more prominent, and the Packers have allowed opposing running backs to go for at least receiving yards four times, yielding multiple paths for fantasy production.

Since returning from a five-week absence due to a concussion, Tagovailoa has completed at least 71% of his attempts, while taking more shots downfield, averaging at least 7.4 yards per attempt in four straight outings. A Thanksgiving matchup with the Packers offers a defense that's allowing 7.2 yards per attempt, ranking a middling 18th, but weather concerns could hinder production. Even so high point total suggests a potential shootout, leaving Tagovailoa low end starter with a high ceiling.

Though the Dolphins passing attack enjoyed a fruitful Week 12, Tyreek Hill was again middling, turning in just five catches on six targets for 48 yards. It marked the third straight game where Hill hasn't topped 10.0 yards per catch while snapping a two-game scoring streak. He's been reduced to short throws with the opportunity to make plays in space, making for a touchdown dependent option in Week 13 against a Green Bay defense that's allowed 14 touchdown receptions through 11 games. As always, you can't bench Hill given the immense upside, but Thursday's matchup outdoors in Lambeau Field doesn't profile as one where Hill pops.

Miami's passing attack appears to be trending upward, but a Week 13 matchup outdoors at Green Bay doesn't jump off the page as a smash spot despite facing a secondary that's allowing 7.2 yards per carry, ranking 18th.

It's always best avoiding chasing prior totals, but at a position void of reliable options, Smith looks the part, gathering at least six targets in five of Miami's six games since a Week 6 bye. Green Bay awaits in Week 13, a defense that's allowed at least 42 yards to the position in nine of their 11 games, with three of their last six opponents registering 82 or more yards, landing Smith as a comfortable starter.

Cold conditions and uncertain wind await in Week 13 at Green Bay, facing a defense that's allowing only 20.3 points per game, but it also features a high point total of 47.5 and the potential for a back-and-forth flow, potentially keeping Sanders busy.

Beckham hasn't topped three catches or 17 yards to date, and there's nothing to suggest a growing role is in store. Week 13 offers a short week and a trip to Green Bay, giving no opportunity for a new game plan or opportunity for at best a team's fifth option in the passing attack, keeping Beckham off fantasy radars.

Josh Jacobs will look to keep up his tremendous momentum as the Packers prepare for a Week 13 home game on Thanksgiving against Miami. After briefly exiting Green Bay's 38-10 trouncing of the 49ers, Jacobs quickly retook the field to finish the day with an impressive 26 carries for 106 yards, not to mention three rushing TDs. Despite Jacobs having totaled just four rushing touchdowns in his 10 prior appearances with the Packers, his three-score effort against San Francisco was enough to surpass his totals from 2023. Jacobs has been highly efficient as the lead man of Green Bay's backfield, averaging 4.7 yards per carry on the season. He'll be well-positioned to continue finding success on Thanksgiving against a Dolphins defense that ranks just middle-of-the-pack against the run, but No. 8 against the pass.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Jordan Love and the Packers will look to keep rolling at home against the Dolphins on Thanksgiving in Week 13. He didn't have to do much other than throw two scores in a lopsided win over the Brock Purdy-less 49ers, logging just 163 yards passing yards and rushing just once for another two yards. The 38-10 win featured Love attempting his third fewest passes on the season, while backfield leader Josh Jacobs overcame cramping to log his second-highest rushing total of the season at 26 attempts. The decision to lean on Jacobs as the offense's engine proved fruitful for Green Bay, as his 26 carries turned into 107 yards and three scores on the ground. Against a Miami defense that ranks eighth against the pass, but is more susceptible to the run, it would behoove the Packers to deploy a similar recipe on Thanksgiving.

Jayden Reed will work to bounce back as the Packers host the Dolphins on Thanksgiving in Week 13. The second-year pro was limited to just three catches for 26 yards during Green Bay's 38-10 win over the 49ers, a game in which QB Jordan Love only had to throw for 163 yards. Reed has now logged three or less catches in four of his prior five outings, with only one TD to complement his lackluster production in that span. A tough matchup on a short week against Miami's secondary, which ranks No. 8 against the pass, isn't an ideal scenario for Reed to bounce back. Even though Josh Jacobs is fresh off a 26-carry game, the Packers could realistically opt to lean on the run.

Christian Watson will look to bounce back from a catchless day as the Packers prepare for a Thanksgiving matchup against the Dolphins in Week 13. Especially given that he was coming off his best game of the season, a 150-yard performance against the Bears, it was disappointing to see Watson fail to hail in any of his three targets during Green Bay's 38-10 win over the 49ers, including a drop on a would-be touchdown. His lone gain of the day came in the form of a four-yard rush. Watson won't be in an ideal spot to bounce back against Miami's secondary, which is allowing the eighth fewest yards per game to opposing pass-catchers, but he'll figure to at least handle an increased role if Romeo Doubs' concussion forces him to sit out.

Dontayvion Wicks will work to again avoid being shut out again as the Packers host the Dolphins for a Thanksgiving day contest in Week 13. After back-to-back games being held without a catch, Wicks bounced back with at least one notable play, a 25-yard reception, during Green Bay's 38-10 win over San Francisco. While that represents a step forward, it's overall most noteworthy that Wicks has just two games on the season with over 30 receiving yards. Even if Romeo Doubs' concussion forces him to sit out versus Miami, due to the matchup against a tough secondary and Wicks' proclivity to disappear, he won't be a reliable candidate for production.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Tucker Kraft will continue to operate as Green Bay's top tight end heading into a Week 13 home game against the Dolphins on Thanksgiving. The second-year pro scored his sixth touchdown of the season during the Packers' 38-10 win over San Francisco, securing both of his targets for 26 yards and a touchdown. Though a modest performance by the standard of Kraft's demonstrated upside, it was encouraging to see him bounce back after having been held without a catch during Green Bay's prior win over Chicago. In the event that Romeo Doubs' concussion holds him out versus Miami, Kraft will be a candidate for increased work around the intermediate area of the field.
