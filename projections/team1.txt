WEEK 13 Outlook:
Jahmyr Gibbs and the Lions will look to retain their firm first place lead in the NFC North heading into a Week 13 matchup against the fourth place Bears. The Thanksgiving day matchup will be an opportunity for Gibbs - who has scored seven rushing touchdowns in his last six appearances - to thrive on a primetime stage. Gibbs is already up to 10 rushing scores on the year, matching his previous career-high mark from 2023, despite having logged just one TD in the receiving game. He notably outproduced backfield mate David Montgomery during Detroit's 24-6 win over Indianapolis, with a 21-90-2 rushing line while Montgomery went 8-37-1. The final split was heavily influenced by Montgomery exiting in the third quarter with a shoulder injury, but if both backs are available to play Thursday, Gibbs and Montgomery could both thrive against a Chicago defense that ranks 20th against the run but has allowed the third-fewest passing touchdowns to opponents.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Amon-Ra St. Brown will continue to lead Detroit's passing attack as the team prepares for a Thanksgiving day divisional matchup against Chicago in Week 13. The star wideout had his eight-game TD streak broken during the Lions' 24-6 win over Indianapolis, but he remained productive with six catches for 62 yards. St. Brown has now logged six or more targets in four straight games, but keeping up his momentum against the Bears' impressive secondary will be no easy feat. Chicago is fresh off having limited Justin Jefferson to just 27 yards in an overtime loss to the Vikings, and the team could again deploy a defensive scheme that prioritizes removing Jared Goff's No. 1 receiver.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
David Montgomery will work to get healthy and continue operating as the thunder to Jahmyr Gibbs' lightning as the Lions prepare for a Thanksgiving day matchup against the Bears in Week 13. He rushed just eight times for 37 yards during Detroit's 24-6 win over the Colts, with one touchdown. Gibbs, meanwhile, more than doubled up Montgomery with 21 carries for 90 yards and two scores, as a result of Montgomery being forced off the field in the third quarter due to a shoulder injury. He reportedly intends to play through the issue on Thanksgiving day, but if Montgomery is at anything less than 100 percent health, the Lions could reasonably opt to again allot Gibbs a the largest share of backfield work. Still, the Bears are more susceptible against the run (ranking 20th) than the pass (third-fewest passing TDs allowed), so Montgomery could be involved enough to produce even if his overall workload were limited.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Jameson Williams will look to continue demonstrating consistency as the Lions prepare for a Thanksgiving day divisional matchup against the Bears in Week 13. During Detroit's 24-6 win over Indianapolis it was Williams, not Amon-Ra St. Brown, who led the team with 64 receiving yards on five catches. Of course, St. Brown wasn't far behind with six grabs for 62 yards, and neither reached the end zone as Jared Goff was held without a passing touchdown. It's possible the Bears again deploy a defensive gameplan that relies on limiting the opposing No. 1 receiver, while allowing the No. 2 option less attention. In Chicago's most recent loss to the Vikings, in overtime, the Bears allowed just 27 yards to Justin Jefferson while Jordan Addison went off to the tune of a 162-yard receiving line.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Sam LaPorta will look to do more with his opportunities as the Lions prepare for a Thanksgiving day divisional matchup against the Bears in Week 13. In his return from a one-game absence due to a shoulder injury, LaPorta garnered an impressive six targets, the third-most on the team. He translated those into just three grabs for 19 yards, though, just the fourth time this season LaPorta has been held below 30 yards. Now another game removed from the shoulder issue, however, LaPorta could do a better job of producing in primetime versus Chicago.
