WEEK 13 Outlook:
D'Andre Swift continued to split playing time with Roschon Johnson in Week 12, though he saw several more opportunities in the backfield. Swift finished with 13 carries for 30 yards and four targets for three catches and 35 yards. While Johnson converted a goal line carry for a touchdwon, Swift saw opportunities in other short yardage situations, which should help improve his touchdown likelihood in future games. In Week 13, the Bears face off against a strong Lions rushing defense. Detroit's defense has allowed 95 rushing yards per game this season, fifth best in the league.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
DJ Moore caught all seven of his targets for a season-high 106 yards and a touchdown. Moore was efficient on his targets and led the Bears receivers in snaps and routes run, but he finished behind Keenan Allen, Cole Kmet, and Rome Odunze in targets. Given Chicago's crowded wide receiver depth chart and the volatile weekly performances of Caleb Williams, Moore could continue to be an inconsistent fantasy option in the near-future. In Week 13, the Bears face off against the Lions. Detroit has allowed 227 passing yards per game this season, eighth most in the league.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Keenan Allen led the Bears with 15 targets in Week 12, finishing with a season-best nine receptions for 86 yards and a touchdown. Allen has seen a lot of opportunities under a new offensive coordinator the past two weeks, earning 23 targets in that timespan. While it's a positive sign to see Allen more involved in the offense recently, it was just his first game this season with more than five catches and 50 receiving yards. In Week 13, the Bears face off against the Lions. Detroit has allowed 227 passing yards per game this season, eighth most in the league.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Rome Odunze caught five of 10 targets for 39 yards in Week 12. Odunze has earned just under eight targets per game in his last five starts, though he is posting a catch rate under 60-percent in that time span. While it's a positive sign that Odunze is seeing a lot of opportunities in the offense, his high average depth of target likely plays a role in his mediocre catch rate, making him an inconsistent option for fantasy. In Week 13, the Bears face off against the Lions. Detroit has allowed 227 passing yards per game this season, eighth most in the league.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Cole Kmet earned 10 targets in Week 12, finishing with seven receptions for 64 yards. Kmet played in all of Chicago's offensive snaps, as well. It's unlikely that Kmet will continue to command such a high target share in this offense, and in his four appearances prior to Week 12, he earned just eight total targets. In Week 13, the Bears face off against a Lions defense that has allowed 227 passing yards per game. Detroit has been a very difficult matchup for tight ends this season, and the unit has allowed only 32 yards per game to the position, best in the league.

WEEK 13 Outlook:
Roschon Johnson scored a touchdown in Week 12 for the second consecutive week. While Johnson earned a valuable goal line carry, his opportunities compared to D'Andre Swift were rather limited. Johnson finished with two carries for two yards, and he caught his lone target for 10 yards. Even if Johnson continues to be the preferred option in the red zone for the Bears in Week 13 against the Lions, he needs more consistent opportunities to be a reliable fantasy option. Detroit's defense has allowed 95 rushing yards per game this season, fifth best in the league.
